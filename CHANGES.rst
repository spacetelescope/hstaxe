Some feature notes from the previous IRAF software package
----------------------------------------------------------
- Version 2.4.4:
    axeprep doesn't require direct image column for input list file

- Version 2.4.3:
    - #978 - added full support for astrodrizzle cases with dimen_info not zero
    - #779 - check for subarray input images in axeprep and return an error
    - #678 - dont do background subtraction in axeprep when < 10% pixels are deemed good
    - #1033 - I put a catch in so that if the C code reports 0 good sky pixels no background subtraction is done and it doesn't fatal error out

- Version 2.4.2:
    - #1017 resolved. User reported an error with the "SCI" extension when the segementation image was read in fcubeprep. The code was updated to be more generic in the way headers are read and constructed.

- Version 0.20: PyDrizzle will be automatically run to generate coeffs files
    - if not already present for input image.

- Version 0.21: Syntax for calling PyDrizzle updated for new 'bits' syntax.
    - Created wtran to use wtraxy and wtranback, and hence be MUCH faster in
      list mode.
    - Updated 'raise' statements to use Exception class, to conform to latest
      python syntax rules.

- Version 0.12 for STSDAS 3.3 release, October 2004
