    "[HSTaXe](https://hstaxe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a Python package that provides spectral extraction processes for HST data. **Please be aware that running this notebook requires creating a conda environment from the provided `.yml` file in this notebook's [github repository](https://github.com/spacetelescope/hstaxe/tree/main/cookbooks).** For more details about creating the necessary environment see the notebook's README file.\n",

    "Below, we show the workflow for a basic specral extraction using WFC3/UVIS full frame G280 grism data. **The example data we use in this notebook are available [here](https://stsci.app.box.com/folder/193832071717).** If you would like to use this notebook with the example data, please dowload all required data in the `example_data` subdirectory from the link above, and store it within the same parent directory as this notebook. Once you have the example data directory, this notebook is intended to run continuously without needing to edit any of the cells. \n",

    "    Note that the value for the `DETECT_THRESH` keyword, which sets the minimum value for pixels to be considered, may be changed appropriately for your data. Similarly, `MAG_ZEROPOINT` corresponds to the UVIS zeropoint in AB mags. When using the UVIS grism there are generally only two main direct image filters to choose from, F200LP and F300X. For photometric information and filter zeropoints please see our [photometric calibration webpage](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/wfc3/data-analysis/photometric-calibration/uvis-photometric-calibration).\n",
